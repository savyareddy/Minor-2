# ARCHITECT AND BUILD RIDE SHARING APP TO END AWS CLOUD WEB APPLICATION FROM SCRATCH

Carpooling Service where people can share rides with other people travelling on the same route
**Project Idea:**<br>
Ride-sharing apps are integral to modern transportation, offering solutions to everyday challenges such as traffic congestion and parking difficulties.
They provide convenience and efficiency by reducing the need for personal vehicle usage in urban areas.
This project focuses on the development of a serverless web application for requesting rides from WildRydes.
The architecture of the application involves:
  - A web interface allowing users to select their pickup location and request a ride.
  - Deployment and hosting through AWS Amplify, ensuring scalability and reliability.
  - JavaScript in the browser making calls to a public API and invoking a Lambda function upon ride request.
  - Amazon Cognito facilitating user registration and authentication against the Restful API, ensuring security.
  - Utilization of DynamoDB for persistent storage, storing a record of each ride request for future reference.
The seamless integration of these components creates a user-friendly and efficient ride-sharing experience.
